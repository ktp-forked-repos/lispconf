### Notice

Although I still maintain CL-Graph, my time is not what it was. 
If you run into issues, have ideas, or hit snags, please let me 
know and I'll respond as quickly as I can. Thanks!

### What it is

CL-Graph is a Common Lisp library for manipulating graphs and
running graph algorithms. {remark [TINAA][] documentation for
CL-Graph is [available][9].} Check out the [user's guide](user-guide.html)
for some very old and yet still preliminary documentation. 

   [9]: http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-graph/documentation/

There's also a _very_ old introduction to cl-graph on [unCLog](http://www.metabang.com/unclog/publisha/atinybit.html).

### Mailing Lists

  * [cl-graph-devel][devel-list]: A list for questions,
    patches, bug reports, and so on; It's for everything.

{anchor downloads}

### Where is it

metabang.com is switching from [darcs][] to [git][]
for source control; the current cl-graph repository is on
[github][github-cl-graph] and you can clone it using:

    git clone git://github.com/gwkkwg/cl-graph

(note that you'll also
need to get several other bits and pieces to get CL-Graph to
work. The commands are listed below:

    git clone git://github.com/gwkkwg/cl-containers
    git clone git://github.com/gwkkwg/metabang-bind
    git clone git://github.com/gwkkwg/metatilities-base
    git clone git://github.com/gwkkwg/moptilities

You might also want [dynamic-classes][]:

    git clone git://github.com/gwkkwg/dynamic-classes

CL-Graph (and friends) should also be [ASDF
installable][asdf-install]. Its CLiki home is right
[where][cliki-home] you'd expect.

There's also a handy [gzipped tar file][tarball].
