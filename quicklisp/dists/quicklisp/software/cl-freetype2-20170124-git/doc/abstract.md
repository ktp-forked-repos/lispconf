cl-freetype2
============

This is a general Freetype 2 wrapper for Common Lisp using CFFI.  It's
geared toward both using Freetype directly by providing a simplified
API, as well as providing access to the underlying C structures and
functions for use with other libraries which may also use Freetype.
