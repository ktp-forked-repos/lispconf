+ Should be able to plot functions in 3-d, but currently the sampled
  function data is always interpreted as linear parametrizations
  instead of planar.  Need to allow choice of interpretation.

+ pre-plot-cmd-settings should be deprecated and its functionality
  merged into plot-cmd.  As it stands, plotting settings are divided
  into these two functions unnecessarily.

+ Add new functions to package.lisp, many new functions but I haven't
  added them to the package

+ Split plotting into multiple files

+ Support variable binning for 2d histograms.  Requires using pm3d, so
  need to add 3d plotting functionality and functions to convert 2d
  lines into 3d lines for easily superimposing other lines on a 2d
  histogram using pm3d.

  pm3d support added, need line method for variable-binning-histogram
