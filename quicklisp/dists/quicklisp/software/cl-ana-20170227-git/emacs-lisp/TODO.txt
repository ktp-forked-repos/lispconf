+ Add support for autocompletion of result ids

  To evaluate a form in the superior lisp, use the following:

  (slime-eval `(swank:eval-and-grab-output lisp-code-as-string))

  So, for example, to get the list of target ids in the current
  project,

  (slime-eval `(swank:eval-and-grab-output "(target-ids)"))

  would return to emacs the list of target ids from the current
  project.
